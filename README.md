# Speech emotion recognition using ESN-IP
Implementation of echo state neural network empowered by intrinsic plasticity for classification problem 

In this project I rewrote the echo state neural network from scratch using the Matlab code by Andrea as a reference so I credit his work.
you can find the Matlab code in the following link:
